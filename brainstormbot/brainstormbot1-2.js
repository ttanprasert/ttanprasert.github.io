So, they should express their different opinions. However, they shouldn't do that for too long because it could make them frustrated with each other and hinder productivity.

Too little conflict means that the two students will not have questioned each other or defended their own stances on the issue that they're currently discussing. Too much conflict means that the students will have achieved a satisfying quality of the current argument and will have explored most factors related to the current issues, if they continue to question or argue with each other. If there is too little conflict, respond with 1. Step 2: If there is too much conflict, respond with 2. Your response must not have anything else but the single number.

Our example here is the situation where you steal something back that rightly belongs to you from the beginning. That is, if someone steals something that belongs to you, stealing it back should be permissible. Although it might not be the only possible solution - for you can go to authority and ask them to demand your belongings back for you - it's permissible, morally speaking. <br><b>Argument 2:</b> Other than morality, the opposition that the laws do not permit stealing. However, we still see corruptions happen all the time, which is where politicians steal people's tax into their own pockets. It can be said that the laws or the loopholes of the laws permit a certain group of people to steal. And even if corruption is theoretically illegal as well, the people who made the laws and enforce the laws don't still allow it. So, we can't discuss about the theory and have to focus on how the laws are actually practiced by the law enforcers, who, as we've discussed, do permit stealing in some circumstances.<br><b>Argument 3:</b> It's easy for the opposition to argue that the ideal world is one where nobody steals from one another, and so, by not permitting stealing in any circumstances, we get closer to this ideal. Here, this debate then becomes a battle of pragmatic versus idealistic perspectives of the world. By our pragmatic approach, there are other problems which need to be solved before we can enforce the no-stealing-ever policy, like the laws and who get to make them. Until these circumstances are met, stealing, in the circumstances outlined in the first two arguments, should remain permissible because it is actually the best way to get closer to the idealistic version of our society."
  } else {
    document.getElementById("sampleArg").innerHTML = "<b>Topic:</b> Is stealing ever permissible? <br><b>Stance:</b> NO<br><br><b>Argument 1:</b> Stealing undermines the social contract and trust within a community. When individuals steal, they erode the mutual trust that is essential for a functioning society, leading to social instability and conflict. One might argue that in certain extreme situations, stealing could be justified (e.g., stealing food to survive). But even in extreme situations, there are often alternative solutions such as seeking help from community resources, charities, or social services. Permitting stealing in any form sets a dangerous precedent that can be exploited and lead to broader social harm. <br><b>Argument 2:</b> Laws against stealing are foundational to legal systems worldwide, reflecting a universal agreement on the importance of property rights. Permitting stealing would undermine the legal framework that maintains order and protects individuals' rights. Some might argue that laws are not always just and can be manipulated by those in power. While it is true that laws can be imperfect, the solution is to work towards reforming unjust laws rather than permitting actions that violate the legal principles designed to protect society. Allowing stealing would create chaos and make it difficult to enforce any laws effectively.<br><b>Argument 3:</b> Even if it seems like stealing may be permissible in some cases, it should never be permissible. Stealing causes harm not only to the victim, who loses their property, but also to the perpetrator, who may face legal consequences and social stigma. The negative consequences of stealing outweigh any potential short-term benefits. Some might argue that in desperate situations, the immediate need justifies the act of stealing, but permitting stealing would only postpone the better societal responses to these needs, such as better support and resources provided by the government."
