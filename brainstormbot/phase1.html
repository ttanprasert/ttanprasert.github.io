                <p>John Stuart Mill, a philosopher in the 19th century, proposes the concept of ‘Utilitarianism’ and writes a book of the same title, as a framework for studying morals based on hedonism. He presents the concept of morals utility or the ‘greatest happiness principle’, which ‘holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.’ Judging morality of an action by its desirability raises opposition from a group of philosophers, who are not convinced that pleasure or happiness is the ultimate end in life. Believing that human beings are capable of evaluating actions beyond the notion of pleasure, they claim that his doctrine is one ‘worth only of swine.’ In his book, Mill makes a counterargument, which consists of 2 premises.</p>

                <p>Firstly, Mill claims that quality of pleasure should also be evaluated, and that it is ‘absurd’ to estimate pleasure based on quantity alone. Rather than preferring ‘more’ quantity of pleasure, he argues that humans will not choose a certain kind of pleasure over another, even if the former is of greater quantity. This is due to the quality of pleasure, which is more connected to happiness. And the only ones who can make this decision between two pleasures are those who are acquainted and experienced in both pleasures, equally, ‘irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation.’
            
                <p>Secondly, Mill states that ‘The rule of life’ of a swine is not good enough for human beings. According to him, ‘Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast’s pleasure.’ This unwillingness comes from a sense of dignity as well as the knowledge of several types of pleasures. The knowledge makes them aware of the imperfect happiness in the world and bear with it, while those with lower capability are unconscious of this imperfection. The sense of dignity makes them unenvious of these lower beings and prefer to be ‘a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied.’</p>

                <p>Based on the two premises of Mill's counterargument, do you agree with Mill’s concept of morals utility?</p>

                <p>Since the time of Ancient Greek, there have been intense debates on the cause of human actions. Plato, in particular, holds that reasons govern human actions and constrain passions. However, in <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i>, David Hume believes that all actions arise from passions, and that human’s soul holds the battle between different passions, which constantly emerge in response to particular situations.</p>

                <p>Hume’s arguments consist of 3 main parts. Firstly, he states that ‘abstract or demonstration reasoning never influences any of our actions, but only as it directs our judgment concerning causes and effects.’ He explains that reason is merely the discovery of connection between a certain object and the pain or pleasure it causes. Therefore, it cannot produce any actions, including preventing volition, by itself. This leads to his second argument, which is that action arises from impulse, and that impulse can only be prevented by an opposing impulse. Since, impulse arises from passions, he argues that what happens in our soul is actually the battle between calm and violent passions. He states that all passions are reasonable, as long as they are based on true suppositions and are exerted into actions via the right means. This does not necessarily mean they are caused by reasoning, but that they have reference to reasons in some way. Specifically, a calm passion is more related to reasoning and less emotion, while a violent passion is caused and strengthened mostly by emotions and affections. The ‘strength of mind’, he concludes, is how we overpower the violent passion with the calm one.</p>

                <p>Based on Hume's three-part argument, do you agree with his model of relationship between reason and passion?</p>
